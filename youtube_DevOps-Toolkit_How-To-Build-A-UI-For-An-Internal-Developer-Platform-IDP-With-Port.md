### [How To Build A UI For An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) With Port?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro-h7tsp0qI)

SUMMARY
Platform engineering is becoming increasingly complex, and managing software development tools and APIs can be a challenge. A developer portal like Backstage can provide a single interface to streamline the management of applications, building, and Continuous Integration. However, an alternative, Port, is a developer platform that simplifies life for developers and DevOps. It creates a single platform that serves as a single source of truth for all the infrastructure assets and operations in the organization's tech stack. Port enables users to define, track and execute any action through three critical entities of blueprints, entities, and actions. Its architecture allows users to plug almost anything, irrespective of whether it's Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS infrastructure.

The real power of Port lies in its ability to help define data models and get data from various clusters to use in relation to the already defined blueprints. Port does not boast a proper CLI, but it has an API that enables users to code directly, communicate directly with the Port API or use cURL to access the tool's features, including filtering and customization.

Port allows you to define everything you want or already have. It is unopinionated, which means it allows fine-tuning specifically what matters to you. Actions are perhaps the essential aspect of Port that allow you to automate tasks, including tasks involved in creating Helm charts. Port is usually streamlined and user-friendly, and its API enables users to communicate and integrate easily.

Port is a web UI designed to help users overcome major challenges in cataloging and tracking system performance. While Backstage is comprehensive and entirely free, it can be complicated to navigate and manage the end experience, with most users requiring dedicated developers to manage it effectively.

Port, which emphasizes ease of use and simplicity, is designed to enable users to create and manage UIs and their own experiences with the system, regardless of resource limitations. It is an excellent tool for companies with limited developmental capacity that still wish to optimize their developer experience.

Overall, Port is an excellent platform to build your internal developer platform upon, and while there are limitations, its user-friendliness and flexibility make it well worth considering.

Simplify Platform Engineering with Port: The Unopinionated Developer Platform

Platform engineering is becoming increasingly complex, and managing software development tools and APIs can be a challenge. With so many options available, it can be tough for developers to know where to start. That's where Port comes in.

What is Port?

Port is a developer platform that simplifies life for developers and DevOps. It creates a single platform that serves as a single source of truth for all the infrastructure assets and operations in the organization's tech stack. Its architecture allows users to plug almost anything, irrespective of whether it's Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS infrastructure.

Key Features of Port

The real power of Port lies in its ability to help define data models and get data from various clusters to use in relation to the already defined blueprints. Port allows users to define, track, and execute any action through three critical entities of blueprints, entities, and actions. It is unopinionated, allowing fine-tuning specifically what matters to you. Actions are perhaps the essential aspect of Port that allow you to automate tasks, including tasks involved in creating Helm charts.

Communicating with Port

Port does not boast a proper CLI, but it has an API that enables users to code directly, communicate directly with the Port API or use cURL to access the tool's features, including filtering and customization.

Benefits of Using Port

Port is a web UI designed to help users overcome major challenges in cataloging and tracking system performance. It is streamlined and user-friendly, and its API enables users to communicate and integrate easily. While Backstage is comprehensive, it can be complicated to navigate and manage the end experience, with most users requiring dedicated developers to manage it effectively. Port, which emphasizes ease of use and simplicity, is designed to enable users to create and manage UIs and their own experiences with the system, regardless of resource limitations.

Conclusion

Overall, Port is an excellent platform to build your internal developer platform upon, and while there are limitations, its user-friendliness and flexibility make it well worth considering. Port enables developers to focus on what they do best, rather than worrying about managing infrastructure and assets. Its ability to automate tasks and streamline development processes make it an essential tool for companies with limited developmental capacity that still wish to optimize their developer experience. So why not give Port a try? You may be surprised by just how much it can simplify your platform engineering efforts.
