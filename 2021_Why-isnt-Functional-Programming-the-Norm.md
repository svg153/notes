# [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm? â€“ Richard Feldman](<[https://link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4)>)

## Part 1

2:00m

Killer app:

- Ruby -> Rails
- PHP -> making HTML dynamically
- C -> system programing

6:00m
Potential killer apps

- ELm -> elm-ui
- Clojure -> Datomic
- ReasonML -> revery

### Platforms exclusivity

- ObjC Swift -> Iphone sales
- JavaScript -> platform applications web
  - java slow
  - flash
- C# -> Windows 95
  - Microsoft does not like java because of multiplatform
  - Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code IDEs

### Quick upgrade apps

Considerations: benefits, familiarity, learning curve, ecosystem access, code migration effort

- Typescript and CoffeeScript -> close to javascript but better
- C++ -> C
- Kotlin -> Java

13:00m
JavaScripts vs Lisp in web -> Sum microsystems spend $ in marketing
Perl vs Python and Ruby

### Other popular factors

- Syntax
- Job market
- Community

most popular langs OO (excepts C):

## Part 2

### OO features

19:00m

Go:

- Supports OO style
- No inheritance
- Objects and methods ara syntax sugar for struts and procedures

### Modular programming

23:00m

- Modules -> C++20

26:00m
Object Oriented - Alan key definition

30:00m
C with classes -> C++

33:00m
C++ vs java vs C#

34:30m
Python
Ruby -> better than perl and python

## Part 3 - Style

Function programming style

Why is not the FP style the normal ??

- Kotlin, swift, python, javascript, java and c++ -> more functional adding new features
- hybrid is the norm -> you can use both in the most popular languages

## Part 4 - Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?

Why -> 40:00m
OO the norm ? -> 41:00m
